Project work for the Business and project management course, MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering @ UNIPI, A.Y. 2022/2023 

Please, notice that since OpenAI blocks the API key every time it gets posted on a public repository, you may need to put your own key in the "openai_key.txt" file in order 
to make the code work (if you run it and you get an Authorization error, this is the case). We had no other options to make this work, since this would need an environment variable but still requiring a personal openAI API key<br><br>

Another important aspect to know about the project is that the StableDiffusion model, in order to run, needs a GPU compatible with CUDA, otherwise the application will not
display the image realized by the custom model
